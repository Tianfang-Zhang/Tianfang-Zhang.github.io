  journal={Remote Sensing},
  abstract={The infrared search and track (IRST) system has been widely used, and the field of infrared small target detection has also received much attention. Based on this background, this paper proposes a novel infrared small target detection method based on non-convex optimization with Lp-norm constraint (NOLC). The NOLC method strengthens the sparse item constraint with Lp-norm while appropriately scaling the constraints on low-rank item, so the NP-hard problem is transformed into a non-convex optimization problem. First, the infrared image is converted into a patch image and is secondly solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). In this paper, an efficient solver is given by improving the convergence strategy. The experiment shows that NOLC can accurately detect the target and greatly suppress the background, and the advantages of the NOLC method in detection efficiency and computational efficiency are verified.},

  title={Infrared small target detection via self-regularized weighted sparse model},
  author={Zhang, Tianfang and Peng, Zhenming and Wu, Hao and He, Yanmin and Li, Chaohai and Yang, Chunping},
  abstract={Infrared search and track (IRST) system is widely used in many fields, however, itâ€™s still a challenging task to detect infrared small targets in complex background. This paper proposed a novel detection method called self-regularized weighted sparse (SRWS) model. The algorithm is designed for the hypothesis that data may come from multi-subspaces. And the overlapping edge information (OEI), which can detect the background structure information, is applied to constrain the sparse item and enhance the accuracy. Furthermore, the self-regularization item is applied to mine the potential information in background, and extract clutter from multi-subspaces. Therefore, the infrared small target detection problem is transformed into an optimization problem. By combining the optimization function with alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), we explained the solution method of SRWS and optimized its iterative convergence condition. A series of experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.},

  title={Attention-Guided Pyramid Context Networks for Detecting Infrared Small Target Under Complex Background},
  author={Zhang, Tianfang and Li, Lei and Cao, Siying and Pu, Tian and Peng, Zhenming},
  abstract={Infrared small target detection techniques remain a challenging task due to the complex background. To overcome this problem, by exploring context information, this research presents a data-driven approach called Attention-Guided Pyramid Context Network (AGPCNet). Specifically, we design Attention-Guided Context Block (AGCB) and perceive pixel correlations within and between patches at specific scales via Local Semantic Association (LSA) and Global Context Attention (GCA) respectively. Then the contextual information from multiple scales is fused by Context Pyramid Module (CPM) to achieve better feature representation. In the upsampling stage, we fuse the low and deep semantics through Asymmetric Fusion Module (AFM) to retain more information about small targets. The experimental results illustrate that AGPCNet has achieved state-of-the-art performance on three available infrared small target datasets.},

  booktitle={Proceedings of the 8th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Communications},
  abstract={Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have proven to be a viable approach to compressive sensing (CS). In this work, we propose a DUN called low-rank CS network (LR-CSNet) for natural image CS. Real-world image patches are often well-represented by low-rank approximations. LR-CSNet exploits this property by adding a low-rank prior to the CS optimization task. We derive a corresponding iterative optimization procedure using variable splitting, which is then translated to a new DUN architecture. The architecture uses low-rank generation modules (LRGMs), which learn low-rank matrix factorizations, as well as gradient descent and proximal mappings (GDPMs), which are proposed to extract high-frequency features to refine image details. In addition, the deep features generated at each reconstruction stage in the DUN are transferred between stages to boost the performance. Our extensive experiments on three widely considered datasets demonstrate the promising performance of LR-CSNet compared to state-of-the-art methods in natural image CS.},

  abstract={To improve the detection ability of infrared small targets in complex backgrounds, a novel method based on non-convex rank approximation minimization joint l2,1 norm (NRAM) was proposed. Due to the defects of the nuclear norm and l1 norm, the state-of-the-art infrared image-patch (IPI) model usually leaves background residuals in the target image. To fix this problem, a non-convex, tighter rank surrogate and weighted l1 norm are instead utilized, which can suppress the background better while preserving the target efficiently. Considering that many state-of-the-art methods are still unable to fully suppress sparse strong edges, the structured l2,1 norm was introduced to wipe out the strong residuals. Furthermore, with the help of exploiting the structured norm and tighter rank surrogate, the proposed model was more robust when facing various complex or blurry scenes. To solve this non-convex model, an efficient optimization algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) plus difference of convex (DC) programming was designed. Extensive experimental results illustrate that the proposed method not only shows superiority in background suppression and target enhancement, but also reduces the computational complexity compared with other baselines.},

  abstract={Robust detection of infrared small target is an important and challenging task in many photoelectric detection systems. Using the difference of a specific feature between the target and the background, various detection methods were proposed in recent decades. However, most methods extract the feature in a region with fixed shape, especially in a rectangular region, which causes a problem: when faced with complex-shape clutters, the rectangular region involves the pixels inside and outside the clutters, and the significant grey-level difference among these pixels leads to a relatively large feature in the clutter area, interfering with the target detection. In this paper, we propose a structure-adaptive clutter suppression method, called chain-growth filtering, for robust infrared small target detection. The well-designed filtering model can adjust its shape to fit various clutter structures such as lines, curves and irregular edges, and thus has a more robust clutter suppression capability than the fixed-shape feature extraction strategy. In addition, the proposed method achieves a considerable anti-noise ability by employing guided filter as a preprocessing approach and enjoys the capability of multi-scale target detection without complex parameter tuning. In the experiment, we evaluate the performance of the detection method through 12 typical infrared scenes which contain different types of clutters. Compared with seven state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method shows the superior clutter-suppression effects for various types of clutters and the excellent detection performance for various scenes.},

  abstract={A novel method based on multiscale and multidirectional feature fusion in the shearlet transform domain and kurtosis maximization for detecting the dim target in infrared images with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and serious interference caused by a cluttered and non-uniform background is presented in this paper. First, an original image is decomposed using the shearlet transform with translation invariance. Second, various directions of high-frequency subbands are fused and the corresponding kurtosis of fused image is computed. The targets can be enhanced by strengthening the column with maximum kurtosis. Then, processed high-frequency subbands on different scales of images are merged. Finally, the dim targets are detected by an adaptive threshold with a maximum contrast criterion (MCC). The experimental results show that the proposed method has good performance for infrared target detection in comparison with the nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) method.},

  abstract={As of late, infrared (IR) small-target detection technology is broadly utilized in low-altitude monitoring frameworks, target-tracking frameworks, precise guidance frameworks and forest fire prevention frameworks. In this paper, we propose an infrared small-target detection strategy based on multi-directional multi-scale high-boost response (MDMSHB). First, an eight-direction filtering template is proposed, which can consider the directional information of the image and significantly suppress heterogeneous background such as cloud, linear interference and interface like oceanâ€“sky background. Then, a map based on multi-directional multi-scale high-boost response (MDMSHB map) is calculated. Finally, a straightforward threshold segmentation technique is utilized to get the detection result. The simulation results comparing this method with the four state-of-the-art strategies in six sequences demonstrate that the proposed strategy can adequately suppress heterogeneous background and arbitrary noise. The approach can improve detection rate and reduce false alert rate as well.},

  abstract={Building segmentation from aerial images and 3D laser scanning (LiDAR) is a challenging task due to the diversity of backgrounds, building textures, and image quality. While current research using different types of convolutional and transformer networks has considerably improved the performance on this task, more precise and accurate segmentation methods for buildings are desirable for applications such as automatic mapping. In this study, we propose a general framework termed BuildSeg employing a generic approach that can be quickly applied to segment buildings. Different data sources were combined to increase generalization performance. The approach yields good results for different data sources as shown by experiments on high-resolution multi-spectral and LiDAR imagery of cities in Norway, Denmark, and France. We applied ConvNeXt and SegFormer-based models on the high-resolution aerial image dataset from the MapAI-competition. The methods achieved an IoU of 0.7902 and a boundary IoU of 0.6185 on the test set. We used post-processing to account for the rectangular shape of the objects.This increased the boundary IOU from 0.6185 to 0.6189.},

  abstract={The field of fine-grained semantic segmentation for a personâ€™s face and head, which includes identifying facial parts and head components, has made significant progress in recent years. However, this task remains challenging due to the difficulty of considering ambiguous occlusions and large pose variations. To address these difficulties, we propose a new framework called Mask-FPAN. Our framework includes a de-occlusion module that learns to parse occluded faces in a semi-supervised manner, taking into account face landmark localization, face occlusion estimations, and detected head poses. Additionally, we improve the robustness of 2D face parsing by combining a 3D morphable face model with the UV GAN. We also introduce two new datasets, named FaceOccMask-HQ and CelebAMaskOcc-HQ, to aid in face parsing work. Our proposed Mask-FPAN framework successfully addresses the challenge of face parsing in the wild and achieves significant performance improvements, with a mIoU increase from 0.7353 to 0.9013 compared to the current state-of-the-art on challenging face datasets.},
