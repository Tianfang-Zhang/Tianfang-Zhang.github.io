  journal={Remote Sensing},
  abstract={The infrared search and track (IRST) system has been widely used, and the field of infrared small target detection has also received much attention. Based on this background, this paper proposes a novel infrared small target detection method based on non-convex optimization with Lp-norm constraint (NOLC). The NOLC method strengthens the sparse item constraint with Lp-norm while appropriately scaling the constraints on low-rank item, so the NP-hard problem is transformed into a non-convex optimization problem. First, the infrared image is converted into a patch image and is secondly solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). In this paper, an efficient solver is given by improving the convergence strategy. The experiment shows that NOLC can accurately detect the target and greatly suppress the background, and the advantages of the NOLC method in detection efficiency and computational efficiency are verified.},

  title={Infrared small target detection via self-regularized weighted sparse model},
  author={Zhang, Tianfang and Peng, Zhenming and Wu, Hao and He, Yanmin and Li, Chaohai and Yang, Chunping},
  abstract={Infrared search and track (IRST) system is widely used in many fields, however, itâ€™s still a challenging task to detect infrared small targets in complex background. This paper proposed a novel detection method called self-regularized weighted sparse (SRWS) model. The algorithm is designed for the hypothesis that data may come from multi-subspaces. And the overlapping edge information (OEI), which can detect the background structure information, is applied to constrain the sparse item and enhance the accuracy. Furthermore, the self-regularization item is applied to mine the potential information in background, and extract clutter from multi-subspaces. Therefore, the infrared small target detection problem is transformed into an optimization problem. By combining the optimization function with alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), we explained the solution method of SRWS and optimized its iterative convergence condition. A series of experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.},

  title={Attention-Guided Pyramid Context Networks for Detecting Infrared Small Target Under Complex Background},
  author={Zhang, Tianfang and Li, Lei and Cao, Siying and Pu, Tian and Peng, Zhenming},
  abstract={Infrared small target detection techniques remain a challenging task due to the complex background. To overcome this problem, by exploring context information, this research presents a data-driven approach called Attention-Guided Pyramid Context Network (AGPCNet). Specifically, we design Attention-Guided Context Block (AGCB) and perceive pixel correlations within and between patches at specific scales via Local Semantic Association (LSA) and Global Context Attention (GCA) respectively. Then the contextual information from multiple scales is fused by Context Pyramid Module (CPM) to achieve better feature representation. In the upsampling stage, we fuse the low and deep semantics through Asymmetric Fusion Module (AFM) to retain more information about small targets. The experimental results illustrate that AGPCNet has achieved state-of-the-art performance on three available infrared small target datasets.},

  title={LR-CSNet: Low-rank Deep Unfolding Network for Image Compressive Sensing},
  author={Tianfang, Zhang and Lei, Li and Christian, Igel and Stefan, Oehmcke and Fabian, Gieseke and Zhenming, Peng},
  booktitle={Proceedings of the 8th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Communications},
  abstract={Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have proven to be a viable approach to compressive sensing (CS). In this work, we propose a DUN called low-rank CS network (LR-CSNet) for natural image CS. Real-world image patches are often well-represented by low-rank approximations. LR-CSNet exploits this property by adding a low-rank prior to the CS optimization task. We derive a corresponding iterative optimization procedure using variable splitting, which is then translated to a new DUN architecture. The architecture uses low-rank generation modules (LRGMs), which learn low-rank matrix factorizations, as well as gradient descent and proximal mappings (GDPMs), which are proposed to extract high-frequency features to refine image details. In addition, the deep features generated at each reconstruction stage in the DUN are transferred between stages to boost the performance. Our extensive experiments on three widely considered datasets demonstrate the promising performance of LR-CSNet compared to state-of-the-art methods in natural image CS.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
