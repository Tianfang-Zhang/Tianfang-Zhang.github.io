Hey, thanks for stopping by! 👋

I am pursuing a PhD at [the Laboratory of Imaging Detection and Intelligent Perecption (IDIP Lab)](http://idiplab.uestc.cn/) of [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), supresived by [Prof. Zhenming Peng](https://www.sice.uestc.edu.cn/info/1302/5086.htm)

My PhD research is dedicated to developing trustworthy infrared small target detection methods and also extended to sparse representation, optimization, deep learning and deep unfolding networks. In collaboration with my colleagues, my research interests also include segmentation and image compressive sensing.

Previously, I received a Bachelor’s degree from [UESTC](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) (2017). And I had the pleasure of working at the [Image Section](https://di.ku.dk/english/research/imagesection/) of [Department of Computer Science](https://di.ku.dk/english/), [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/) as a visiting PhD, supervised by [Prof. Jon Sporring](https://sporring.github.io/) and funded by [China Scholarship Council (CSC)](https://www.csc.edu.cn/).
